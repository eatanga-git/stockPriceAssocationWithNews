# stockPriceAssocationWithNews

This is a program that displays data for popular stocks - more spefically, their stock prices over time - and that scrapes the web for articles corresponding to time periods where the stock price underwent a sudden and stark change. This is meant to investigate whether there is an association between the publicity/news of the stock, and the actual stock price (i.e. does negative or positive news about a company negatively or positvely influence the stock price? Or is there little association).
